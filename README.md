# ROD-WGAN-and-ROD-WGAN-hybird-models
ROD-WGAN and ROD-WGAN hybrid models have mimicked protein structure's distance matrices on various large scales.

We use the ADMM algorithm to fold the generated distance matrix.

We provide the generator network and its weight. In addition, the R code of folding protein structure.
